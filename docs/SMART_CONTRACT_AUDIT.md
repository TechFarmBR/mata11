# 🔐 Smart Contract Audit – MATA11 Token (Draft Phase)

This document outlines the security, design, and deployment considerations for the future MATA11 smart contract.

---

## 🔧 Contract Purpose
MATA11 will be deployed as a tokenized debenture in a compliant network (likely Ethereum or Binance Smart Chain).

### Core Functions:
- Token minting (initial supply matching hectares)
- Transfer of ownership
- Monthly return distribution (3%)
- Logic for 2.5-year eligibility check (3% environmental bonus)
- Metadata linkage with conservation asset

## 🔒 Security Best Practices

| Layer                  | Practices Implemented                          |
|------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| Code                  | ✅ SafeMath / overflow protection              |
| Access Control        | ✅ Owner & admin roles (multi-signature if possible) |
| Environmental Bonus   | ✅ Lock/vesting logic conditional by time      |
| Interactions          | ✅ Prevent reentrancy attacks / fallback guards |

---

## 🧪 Testing Requirements
- ✅ Unit tests for transfer, hold time, bonus eligibility
- ✅ Simulation of early withdrawal
- ✅ Simulation of monthly yield transfer
- ✅ Audit by third party (optional)

---

## ⛓ Recommended Networks
- Ethereum (ERC-20)
- Binance Smart Chain (BEP-20)
- Polygon (alternative low fee network)

---

## 📦 Tokenomics Reminder
- 1 Token = R$18,000 in Amazonian preserved land
- Minimum purchase: R$100 (fractionalized)
- Smart contract handles return and condition logic automatically

> 🔍 This draft audit will evolve after choosing the network and coding the contract using Solidity.
